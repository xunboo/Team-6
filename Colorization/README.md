## Introduction

The entrypoint for the colorization model is colorize.py, which takes, as input, a gray image and outputs a color version of the images.
In this case, `python colorize.py [path to filename]`. We have provided some sample black and white images under images. For example, you can try running `python colorize.py images/citizen kane.png`.

Here is an example of running `colorize.py`:

<img src="colorized_images/citizen kane gray.png" width=40%><img src="colorized_images/citizen kane.png" width=40%>
